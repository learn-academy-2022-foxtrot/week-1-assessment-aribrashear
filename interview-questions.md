# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a program meant to store multiple versions of code so that you're able to track different versions of that code for bug solving and testing purposes. Git stands for Global Information Tracker, and it's the platform that Github runs on. So, Github is an interface that allows us to use the program called Git.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system used for tracking and managing changes within your source code. It was originally created as an open-source program meant to make coordinating non-linear tasks between multiple programmers faster and easier. Github is a free, web-based service that allows you to easily access and manage Git repositories. Both Git and Github provide very valuable version-control functionality, and they work in conjunction to allow programmers to efficiently collaborate on projects.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Comparison and logical operators are the Javascript operators that will return a Boolean value. These operators include the and (&&), or (||), and equality (===, ==) operators. These operators will return a Boolean value because they're comparing two pieces of data to check how they're related to each other, and then returning either a true or false value based on the result.

Researched answer: Both comparison and logical operators will return Boolean values. The logical AND operator (&&) returns a boolean value after it checks to see of a set of boolean operands are BOTH true. The logical OR (||) operator checks to see if a set of operands is true, but will return a boolean value of TRUE even if only one of the operands is true. The strict and loose equality operators check to see if two operands are equal, and will return a boolean value based on the result or that operation. All of these operators return boolean values because, in essence, you're asking them to evaluate whether the relation between two pieces of information is true or false.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the specific location where a value is stored inside of an array. Indexes are 0-based, which means that the first element inside of an array will have an index of 0. A value is simply the data that an element (or variable) is holding, and we can use the index of that element in order to access its value.

Researched answer: An index is the specific location of an element inside of an array. A value is simply the data that element contains, which can include things like numbers, strings, and booleans. We can use the index of an element to access the data that it's holding, much like we can call upon a variable to access its declared value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer: Arrays are a list of data that can contain data types like numbers, booleans, and strings. A string is a collection of characters between quotation marks ("") that tells the computer to parse it as plain text. It's used to tell Javascript that you want to parse text or special characters, without including them in any kind of mathematical operation, in a way that makes sense to your computer. Both strings and arrays contain data, and can both contain numbers and characters, but a string will always see input as plain text, while an array can contain both plain text and other data types.

Researched answer: Arrays are an ordered list of values, which can contain different data types like numbers, booleans, and strings. Strings are sequences of characters defined by their placement between quotation marks that can contain letters, numbers, or symbols. Strings are primitive data types that are immutable, whereas arrays are objects that can be changed at any time while a program is running. Both strings and arrays contain data, and can both contain letters, numbers, and symbols - but a string will always see a sequence of characters, while an array may also contain different data types.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is the act of working on a single piece of code as a team. It's very useful for many reasons, like having a second set of eyes if you encounter any bugs, having a second source of knowledge to apply techniques or methods you may not know, and deepening both people's understanding of the concepts they're working with by talking about them together. Generally in pair programming, you'll have one person actively working on the code (referred to as the driver), while the other observes and tells them what to type (referred to as the navigator). It's good practice to switch up these rolls regularly, so that both people get the chance to work through any challenges from a different point of view.

Researched answer: Pair programming is the act of two people writing code together to produce a single result. One person will take on the role of the navigator, who guides the other person as they type. The second person will take on the role of the driver, as they transcribe the code that their navigator is giving them. Proper pair programming techniques involve planning the task you'll be working on ahead of time, setting timers to ensure that both people have time to get some hands-on coding, and making sure to remain open to trying out any suggestions your partner might offer you. Pair programming is useful for many reasons, including having a second set of eyes to help when you inevitably encounter bugs, having multiple sources of knowledge for applying different techniques, and deepening both developers' understanding of the concepts they're working with by talking them through together.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a type of function that accepts multiple functions as arguments, or returns them.

2. Jest: Jest is a framework used for creating, running, and structuring tests to ensure that your code is giving the output you expect it to.

3. Objects: An object in Javascript is a container which holds collections of related data.

4. Method: A method in Javascript is an action that can be performed on objects.

5. Classes: Classes in Javascript are templates used to create objects.
